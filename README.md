This app uses [window_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/window_manager) to control the size of the app on Windows.

At least while running in debug mode, it appears to require Windows to be in Developer Mode. The app will not even start up without that.

To put Windows in Developer Mode:

In a PowerShell terminal, run: `start ms-settings:developers` and turn on developer mode.
